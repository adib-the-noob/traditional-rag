Machine learning fundamentals center on teaching computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. Core steps include collecting and cleaning data, selecting features, choosing a model (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks), and training it by minimizing a loss function with algorithms like gradient descent. We evaluate performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision/recall, RMSE, or AUC on validation/test sets and guard against overfitting with techniques like regularization and cross-validation. Understanding bias-variance trade-offs, data leakage, and proper model deployment/monitoring is essential for building reliable, generalizable systems.
