Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to automatically learn hierarchical representations from data. A neural network is composed of interconnected nodes (“neurons”) organized in layers—input, hidden, and output—that transform inputs through learned weights and nonlinear activations. By training on large datasets with optimization methods like stochastic gradient descent, these models capture complex patterns for tasks such as image recognition, natural language understanding, and speech synthesis. Depth (many layers) enables the network to learn increasingly abstract features, often outperforming traditional methods when ample data and compute are available.
